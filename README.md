- âœ¨ Hi. I'm Elizabeth Grace. My pronouns are she/her. I'm a 28-year-old stenographic court reporter in Minnesota and an active member of the Open Steno community.
- ðŸ’œ This is where I save steno resources that I share with that community.
- âœ¨ You can find me being snarky @StenoWitch on both Instagram and Twitter.
- ðŸ’œ You can find me being genuine but also snarky and still steno-y on @Elizavvitch on Twitter.
- âœ¨ Otherwise, find me on the Plover Discord!
